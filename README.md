## How we get the data

 The data used for this research was downloaded from CnOpenData (https://www.cnopendata.com/data/air-quality.html)

## How we organized the files

City daily: the original city data for every day in the time period
Cleaned data: final used data of 2019
Cleaned data 2020: final used data of 2020
Plots: the final plots we used to analysis
Simulation data: the simulation codes and simulated results, this includes tests and extra data cleaning for simulation
Concat_data: concat the daily data in a full dataset
Make_plot: Form the plots we used in analysis
Method: Define and differentiate the data time periods we use

## How we run the analysis
(1)We run Monte Carlo simulation and use permutation test to test our null hypothesis. This provides a conclusion for our further analysis.
(2)Based on the conclusions we obtained in the simulation, we further used time series graphs and cleaned real data to comprehensively analyze the reasons for the changes in AQI values ​​in different time periods based on the results and the policies we investigated.
